Deliverables 
====
The deliverables for the teams are:

1. A Requirements Document: this is a live document that is updated and submitted every two weeks, 
based on the new understanding of the problem as it emerges from team discussions and meetings 
with the customer. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 

2. An Architecture Document: this is a live document that presents the high-level structure of 
the system. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 

3. Every two weeks a new version of the source code should be submitted, via a Pull Request to 
master. The Teaching Assistants provide feedback on every pull request (See: [Feedabck and Grading](https://github.com/mircealungu/se-course-best-practices/blob/master/TA%20Duties.md#feedback-and-grading)).

4. An Minimum Viable Product -- should be delivered at least one month before the end of the course
if not more. In the first iteration of the course we asked for it one month in the course and this
was much too ambitious.

4. A Final Presentation will be delivered by every team in the last lecture of the course. 

5. Final Submission -- should include the final versions of the Requirements and Architecture Documents 
as well as the final version of the code. 


Two Week Iterations
--
In the first incarnation of the course we had one-week iterations. 
It was too stressful for the students since they have little to show
given that, in our context, they had several other courses to work on.

For the second and the third run of the course we had two-week "sprints"
and it worked much better.
