Deliverables 
====
The deliverables for the teams are:

1. A Requirements Document: this is a live document that is updated and submitted every two weeks, 
based on the new understanding of the problem as it emerges from team discussions and meetings 
with the customer. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 
**Note**: The first deadline which is two weeks from the beginning of the project might be 
delayed because of the customers who might not have the time to meet with the students. 
It had happened to us (Mircea, Estefania) and we always gave the students an extension for this.
Might be good to talk to the customers beforehand and let them know that they should be 
available in the first two weeks.

2. An Architecture Document: this is a live document that presents the high-level structure of 
the system. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 

3. Every two weeks a new version of the source code should be submitted, via a Pull Request to 
master. The Teaching Assistants provide feedback on every pull request (See: [Feedabck and Grading](https://github.com/mircealungu/se-course-best-practices/blob/master/TA%20Duties.md#feedback-and-grading)).

4. An Minimum Viable Product -- should be delivered midway through the semester. This is usually
after three iterations. We normally organized the [intermediate presentations](https://github.com/mircealungu/se-course-best-practices/blob/master/example-documents/README.md#example-structure-intermediate-presentation) 
for the MVP. Every team gets to present for 7 -- 10 minutes (depending on how many teams there are). 
Then there are 5 minutes of discussion. The Teaching Assistants and the Lectures participate, and 
grade the presentation. This milestone is the opportunity to also provide the [Intermediate Grade](https://github.com/mircealungu/se-course-best-practices/blob/master/evaluation/Grading.md#intermediate-grade). 

4. A Final Presentation will be delivered by every team in the last lecture of the course. 

5. Final Submission -- should include the final versions of the Requirements and Architecture Documents 
as well as the final version of the code. Everything is submitted via a PR to the master of the project
on GitHub. If the software has also been deployed online or in an app store, the link should be in the 
Readme.md of the master. 


Notes
--
**Two Week Iterations**.

In the first incarnation of the course we had one-week iterations. 
It was too stressful for the students since they have little to show
given that, in our context, they had several other courses to work on.
For the second and the third run of the course we had two-week "sprints"
and it worked much better. 

**Minumum Viable Product**.

In the first iteration of the course we asked for it one month in the course 
and this was much too ambitious. Midway through the semester is more doable.
