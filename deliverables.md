The deliverables for the teams are:

1. A Requirements Document: this is a live document that is updated and submitted every two weeks, 
based on the new understanding of the problem as it emerges from team discussions and meetings 
with the customer. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 

2. An Architecture Document: this is a live document that presents the high-level structure of 
the system. For examples see the [example documents](/example-documents) folder. 

3. Every two weeks a new version of the source code should be submitted, via a Pull Request to 
master. The Teaching Assistants provide feedback on every pull request (See: [Feedabck and Grading](https://github.com/mircealungu/se-course-best-practices/blob/master/TA%20Duties.md#feedback-and-grading)).

4. A Final Presentation will be delivered by every team in the last lecture of the course.
